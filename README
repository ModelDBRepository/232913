Model-based smoothing of noisy voltage measurements. This code is released in
conjunction with the following publication 

  Huys QJ and Paninski L (2007): Model-based filtering of, and parameter
  estimation from, noisy biophysical observations.

SmoothVoltageData.m is a MATLAB m-file, which containts a few functions. 

It sets up a single-compartment cell with Hodgkin-Huxley channels, adds noise to
the voltage and then and runs a particle smoother on data to recover the
underlying voltage. 

To run it, add this folder to the MATLAB path, type 

	SmoothVoltageData

and hit return.
